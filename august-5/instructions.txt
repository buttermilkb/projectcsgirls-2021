So far we've learned how to successfully navigate a filesystem
using Unix commands. We've also learned how to create, edit, 
and read these files. Now, we just learned some things we can
 do with these files.

Today, I will have you all perform a series of commands on the
files and directories located in the august-5 directory.

Some commands to keep in mind for today:
mv - move file
rm - remove file
mkdir - make directory
rmdir - remove empty directory

Exercise 1:
Looks like you accidentally misplaced an email called back2school!
Yikes, it's pretty important. Try to find it and put it in your school
category of your inbox!

Exercise 2:
Your teachers send you emails about assignments, but they clutter up
your school inbox a lot. You might want to organize a bit...
Make 3 different directories inside your school inbox called math, science,
and English.

Exercise 3:
Now that you've got your new categories, move the emails corresponding
to the correct tag inside your school inbox into the math, science, or 
English categories!
Hint: not all emails inside the school inbox will go into one of the 
subcategories.

Exercise 4:
There's been someone emailing your nonstop about how much they love you, 
but you have no idea who they are! Nor do you know why they keep ending
up in your school inbox. Move this email to the trash directory.

Exercise 5:
Looks like you won't be needing party-at-daniel anymore, it's already
happened a while ago! Move it into the trash directory.

Exercise 6:
Whew! That's a lot of emails in your trash directory. Let's empty that
out. Remove all the files inside your trash directory.
