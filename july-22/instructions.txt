Welcome to the second class of ProjectCSGirls 2021!

Today is focused on getting set up and learning very simple navigation.
Let's put some of our new skills to use!
Remember: you can call me into your breakout room if you need help.

Some commands to keep in mind for today:
ls - list
cd - change directories
pwd - print working directory

Exercise 1:
What directory is this file (instructions.txt) located in?

Exercise 2:
Poke around the directories a bit inside the family directory. Which directory is the file "water-bottle" located in?

Exercise 3:
Which directory is the file "cup" located in?

Exercise 4:
Count how many grandchildren directories you see. How many are there?
