8/12/2021:

Congratulations on completing the last class of the
summer term for ProjectCSGirls 2021 Oregon Chapter!

Over the course of these 5 weeks, you have not only
configured your device to be able to support a terminal,
but you have also learned a couple basic commands that
will help you navigate your filesystem (and you will
also look super cool doing it as well).

Just to be completely clear, you have accomplished something
BIG. Most computer science students don't learn this until
college or maybe even the industry. As middle schoolers,
you are leading the pack!

To briefly review, we have learned how to use:
- ls
- cd
- pwd
- cat
- head
- tail
- nano
- touch
- mv
- rm
- mkdir
- rmdir
... and many more!

Today is mostly tying up loose ends. We learned how to
copy files, and how to use the man command.

Some commands to keep in mind:
cp - copy files
man - open manual to a command

Exercise 1:
Return to the august-5 directory and finish the exercises
that you have not completed.

Exercise 2:
In the inbox directory of august-5, notice there is school party
in the school directory? Make a copy of that file and transfer it
into social as well.

Exercise 3:
Open the manuals to the commands rm and cp, which tag do you notice
we covered in class?
